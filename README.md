coderwabbit is a web app that automatically reviews and analyses GitHub repositories. It focuses on code quality, security, and maintainability, providing actionable feedback and insights in a simple dashboard after you log in with GitHub.

## Features

- Language detection (JavaScript/TypeScript or Python; more coming soon)
- Dependency installation
- Code quality, complexity, and duplication analysis
- Security checks and recommendations
- Simple dashboard for results

## Workflow

1. Log in with GitHub
2. Select a repository to analyse
3. The app pulls repo details and prepares for code review and security analysis
4. View results and suggestions in the dashboard

## Focus

- Automated code review (not style linting)
- Security analysis (flagging unsafe code, secrets, and dependency issues)
- Maintainability and best practices

> Note: IDEs handle style linting and formatting. coderwabbit focuses on deeper code review and security.
